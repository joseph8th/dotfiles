# Dotfile paths are relative to $HOME.
# BUT, bash commands are relative to this file! Use absolute for the following.
# Specify bash command with leading '$ ' (note the space):
#   '$C ' - do on collect (capital-C)
#   '$D ' - do on deposit (capital-D)

# Gotta git my .emacs.d bih ...
.emacs.d

# But when I collect I don't want my old sessions (I could add `session.*` to .gitignore) ...
# NOTE relative paths are relative to THIS FILE!

$C rm ./dotfiles/.emacs.d/session.*

# And when I deposit I wanna see my new .emacs.d ...
# NOTE absolute path!

$D ls ~/.emacs.d

# BE CAREFUL! Because YES you can eval arbitrary valid bash (or invalid FTM).

# The rest of these don't need any hand-holding so just copy
