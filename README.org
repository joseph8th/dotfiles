My script to collect and deposit dotfiles, along with the dotfiles themselves.

* Install

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/joseph8th/dotfiles.git
#+end_src

* Usage

#+begin_example
usage: dot.sh {collect|deposit}
#+end_example

Edit =Dotfile= and list your dotfiles relative to =$HOME= (script won't create trees so keep that in mind). The script will respect the order of the lines and process sequentially.

** Comments

Empty lines and lines starting with a '#' will be ignored.

** Eval Commands

If you want to do something after collecting or depositing, you can add a command to =eval= at runtime with by starting the line with one of:

- =$ = (run on collect OR deposit)
- =$C = (run on collect only)
- =$D = (run on deposit only)

** Example

#+begin_example
.emacs.d
$C rm ./dotfiles/.emacs.d/session.*
.bashrc
#+end_example
